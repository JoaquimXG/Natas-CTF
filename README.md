# Natas-CTF 

![Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)

This project is intended to create a collection of dscrete scripts for the web based CTF Natas. 

Each script will autonomously gather the password for the corresponding level number and includeds notes for how it is operated. 

## Using the scripts 

The scripts are mostly written in python3 apart from one or two in php and each can be considered for use on it's own.
